## This is my portfolio developed in Next JS
The main reference was GITBOOK.

### How does it works?
There is a SSR behind that loads a json stored in a S3 Bucket and provides information about my career, life and future paths.

### What this is about?
For instance, I am showing my past projects, but the intention is to show future projects in engineering, programming and DS.
